“Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.” - William Shakespeare

Hi Eveerybody!

I'm really just here to poke around.
I want to get an idea of what to expect when I go back to school.
If I had to choose between either eating tacos or burgers and giving up the other forever,
I would starve because I'm REALLY indecisive.
